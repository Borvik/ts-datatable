## [1.3.1] - 2021-03-08
### Changed
- Changed dev/build process to _not_ be based on create-react-app, and _not_ require webpack for release builds. This prevents webpack from obfuscating the function/component names and allows them to be seen in React Developer Tools for applications using this component.

## [1.3.0] - 2021-02-19
### Added
- Added option to _not_ use HTML5 dialogs, and instead use a div styled like a dialog. This should make it easier for the filter editor to have a custom editor that has a custom dropdown appended to the `body` that has a higher z-index than the dialog.

### Changed
- Updated to use CommonJS version of `@borvik/use-querystate` and `@borvik/querystring`.
